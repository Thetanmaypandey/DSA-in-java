/*
    1.Every Java program must have at least one class. The class name should follow PascalCase naming convention. i.e. "public class HelloWorld"
    2.Every Java program must have a main method, which serves as the entry point for execution.i.e. "    public static void main(String[] args)"
    3.public: Allows the method to be accessible from anywhere.

static: Belongs to the class, so it can be executed without creating an instance.

void: Indicates that the method does not return any value.

String[] args: Command-line arguments.
